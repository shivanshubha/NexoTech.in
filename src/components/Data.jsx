      "100% steel wire mesh, often referred to as 100 SS, is a type of wire mesh made entirely from stainless steel wires. The term 100 SS typically refers to the mesh count, indicating the number of openings per linear inch in the mesh. In this case, 100 SS would mean there are 100 openings per linear inch.Stainless steel wire mesh is known for its durability, corrosion resistance, and high strength-to-weight ratio. It is commonly used in applications where these properties are important, such as filtration, sieving, and screening. The fine mesh size of 100 SS makes it suitable for applications requiring precise filtration or separation of particles.",

      "100% steel wire mesh with one end of para-aramid yarn (SS 1PA) is a composite material that combines the properties of stainless steel wire mesh with para-aramid yarn. The stainless steel wire mesh provides durability, corrosion resistance, and strength, while the para-aramid yarn adds additional strength and heat resistance.The addition of the para-aramid yarn can enhance the overall performance of the mesh in certain applications. Para-aramid yarn, such as Kevlar, is known for its high tensile strength, low elongation, and resistance to abrasion, heat, and chemicals. When combined with stainless steel wire mesh, it can improve the mesh's resistance to impact, puncture, and high temperatures. This composite material is often used in applications where high strength and heat resistance are required, such as in protective clothing, industrial filters, and high-performance composites.",

The stainless steel wire mesh provides durability, corrosion resistance, and strength, while the para-aramid yarn adds additional strength, heat resistance, and other beneficial properties. The inclusion of two ends of para-aramid yarn further enhances the performance of the composite material compared to one end. Para-aramid yarn, such as Kevlar, is known for its high tensile strength, low elongation, and resistance to abrasion, heat, and chemicals. When combined with stainless steel wire mesh, it can significantly improve the mesh's resistance to impact, puncture, and high temperatures. This composite material is commonly used in applications where exceptional strength and heat resistance are required, such as in protective clothing, industrial filters, and high-performance composites for aerospace and automotive industries. The dual para-aramid yarn reinforcement provides additional strength and durability to the steel wire mesh, making it suitable for demanding applications.",
